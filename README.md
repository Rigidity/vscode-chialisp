# Chialisp Language Support
This is an unofficial Visual Studio Code extension that provides syntax highlighting for [Chialisp](https://chialisp.com), which is made by the [Chia](https://chia.net) team. This language is a variation of Lisp, and the highlighting is similar, but with highlighting for the symbols that Chialisp specifically uses.
